It is my favorite sport to play and watch. At 2 and a half years old I started to skate and then play hockey. I enjoy playing with all my friends. I play city hockey and school hockey.</p></td>

I love watching the game of hockey on tv and going to the arena to watch teams play. Then growing older I then idolized Sidney Crosby. For those who do not know him, he is number 87 on the Pittsburgh Penguins ad the captain of his team. I began to choose the Pittsburgh Penguins as y favorite team n the NHL. The Pittsburgh Penguins contain many good players such as; Jake Guentzel, Kris Letang, Evgaeni Malkin, Tristan Jarry and Sidney Crosby. I love how Sidney Crosby plays on the ice. He has Speed, Strength, Coordination, Stamina, hockey IQ and overall he is respectful towards his teammates. I wtch him play hockey on tv and I see that his skating is fluid on the ice and he scores many goals. Overall The Pittsburgh Pengiuns are my favorite NHL team. </p></td>
